# Local Libray Project

This is a project for a library to keep track of their accounts and books. You can find the total amount of books, the total amount of accounts, the most popular books or genres, and many more useful functions that you might need while organizing a local library. 

This was my first project creating my own Javascript functions that would interact with the user and make the page interactive, by showing new data when the user requested it. I like the keep the functions working with the original code so I can look back and see how I grew as a programmer.

## Goals

- Use Visual Studio Code as a text editor.
- Differentiate between the three most common JavaScript error types.
- Solve bugs by using error messages.
- Differentiate between let, const, and var, and use each appropriately.
- Create an array from a string based on particular criteria and join arrays into strings.
- Write strings that embed expressions using template literals.
- Access all the values and keys of an object.

## Tech Stack

**Tools:** Javascript, HTML, CSS

**Client:** Good ol HTML

**Server:** This file has data hard coded in. This was made just to test the Javascript functions so no API was connected.
